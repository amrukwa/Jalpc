- name: K-means in Python
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/amrukwa/kmeans_python

  desc: I strived to follow the scikit-learn pipelines during the algorithm implementation. To make visualization possible, I also implemented PCA algorithm. I programmed different initialization methods, as well as Dunn Index to find the optimal number of clusters. To validate the results, I wrote k-cross validation.
  
- name:  K-means in C++

  desc: For this project, I started with designing the ML canvas, which helped me define the scope of the project. I implemented most of the necessary classes by myself, letting the user choose the initialization method, distance metrics, index for finding the optimal number of classes. I also implemented the PCA algorithm alongside the k-means. The whole code was consistently unit tested.
  
- name: Conway Game of Life
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/amrukwa/conway-game-of-life
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/conway.png
  desc: In this project I wrote a simple conway game of life in C. Moreover, I tried some basics of continous integration using appveyor.

- name: Hangman
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/amrukwa/hangman
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/hangman.png
  desc: A hangman game for both one and two players. I took care of version control and managed to make an integrated release of both program and dictionary file.

- name: Shortest Path Search
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/amrukwa/shortest_path
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/road.PNG
  desc: The project is an implementation of Dijkstra algorithm in C++. The whole program can be invoked from the command line, providing additional guidance to the user. Moreover, I automatized the unit tests, as well as releases, with the usage of custom Github Actions via workflows I prepared.
  
- name: Spam detection
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/amrukwa/spam_detection
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/message.png
  desc: In this project I built a simple spam detection application for e-mails using a SVM model and Bag of Words. Then I deployed it with Flask and Docker.
  
- name: Mask detection
  i18n: jalpc
  url: https://github.com/amrukwa/mask_detection
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/mask.png
  desc: I built a simple Random Forest Classifier checking if on the face (previously detected by openCV DNN) there is a mask, correctly placed. The program marks the face as well as annotate the result. I deployed the model as Docker container with Flask. The app runs on images, as well as live stream video.
